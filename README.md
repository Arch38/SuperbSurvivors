Update 15 Experimental - U1

This will be in experimental until there is enough additions to make it public-worthy

* Updated "LootCategoryTask:ForceFinish()" function to avoid nil errors. Thanks to Chingling152 for this knowledge!!
* Started cleaning code of the AI-Manager.Lua file


Update 15 Experimental - U2
* Cleaned up SuperSurvivorOptions.lua - the more files cleaned, the more optimized the mod will be - Special thanks to Chingling152 for helping make this happen!


Update 15 Experimental - U3
* Updates to the Debug mode - To be able to find bugs, we must create a more diverse debugging system. And now the in game options has that. 


Experimental 15 - U4
* Updates to the "DebugCharacterUnStuck", so when right click unstuck an NPC, the NPC in question may actually move now. 
* * (This needs more testing)
* Made an adjustment to how 'NPCs Get stuck management' is handled, which was causing NPCs to 'stutter walk' during some instances. 
* * (Also needs testing to see how NPCs are moving around)
