Superb Survivors mod for Project Zomboid is a community-driven project that aims to keep the mod up-to-date with the latest game versions. It's important to note that this is an unofficial project, and as such, it may not always be consistently updated.

The mod is hosted on GitHub, and the repository is maintained by a user who is trying to keep the source code in line with the current release game version. The official mod on Steam is several versions ahead of the source this repository is forked from, which is why this fork was created.

To install this mod, you would need to install the original mod from Steam, make a copy of the "Superb-Survivors" folder, and then download this fork into a unique location. The client, server, and shared folders from this fork should be copied to where the copy of the original mod was created in the media\lua folder. Any new versions of the mod released on Steam will not affect the local copy/modified version.
