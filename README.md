I couldn't repair whatever I broke. I reverted it back before working EXP 14. 

This mod really is a mess. 


7:08 pm - I pulled the code from the non-revisited version's function "attack(victim)" function. 
I will be using that for guns, because I checked, and it works, as long as I keep the melee, and the guns functions related seperated.

I'll have a new EXP 14 out later tonight.
