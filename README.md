Special thanks to NightScale for this addition! 

EXP 16 - U2

* Added in game option to hide/display NPCs names
* Added in game option to hide/display the red color on hostile NPCs


EXP 16 - U3
-
* Expansion to the Clothing set rarity. So now you can have more tiers of rare chance choices.
ALL THE WAY UP TO legendary 1%

(*Because someone will request it*)


EXP 16 - U4
-
* Added an in game option to hide 'roleplay messages' the kind of messages you would see npcs do like ' *Reloading gun* ' with * in the text. You now have the ability to disable that if you like. 
* Updated PTBR localization - Thanks to ruannuness for this!


Experimental 16 - U5
-
(since I did not post update notes in last upload)

* Fixed the clothing mod bug returning 'legendary' rolls as null

* NPCs under the new Pursue_se function should now obey locked door rules more often and will be less likely to get stuck once again =)

* Made adjustments to the Pursue_se and scores functions.
NPCs should be a little bit better reacting with their surroundings.

(*THIS WILL NEED TESTING & FEEDBACK, PLEASE*)

*Weapons expanded* Just like the clothing, you now can make your own addon mods for base weapons and modded weapons into superior survivors!
